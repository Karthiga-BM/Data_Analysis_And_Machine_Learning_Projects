              "'Stay informed every day with Yahoo Finance\\'s free Fully Briefed newsletter. Renewed political tensions between the U.S. and China — which came to light this week as the Biden administration sat down with their Chinese counterparts for the first time to discuss a range of issues — could ensnarl vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA), which has pushed successfully into China in recent years. In fact, the heightened rhetoric between the two super economic superpowers may have already had blowback on Elon Musk\\'s electric car company. The Chinese government is restricting the use of Tesla vehicles by military staff and employees of vital state-owned companies, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. Chinese officials reportedly have concerns that Tesla\\'s cars — outfitted with various data collecting capabilities — could serve as leakers of national security secrets. \"I have been saying for months now that Tesla\\'s level of integration of their business, of their research, of their sort of geo-tracking for which there is integration with Chinese maps, their development of A.I. with Chinese firms, and electric battery technology that\\'s not sustainable in China given the trajectory [on policy] that we are now on,\" policy expert and Eurasia Group founder Ian Bremmer said on Yahoo Finance Live. \"Most American A.I. and technology companies are seen as critical for national security, they don\\'t have access in China — companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. Tesla is the outlier.\" That outlier status has made China an incredibly important market for Tesla, and a key part of the investment thesis in the stock. Tesla\\'s sales in China clocked in at $6.66 billion in 2020, up 123% from a year earlier powered by strength in the Model 3. The business made up about 21% of Tesla\\'s overall 2020 sales. Tesla began deliveries of its China-made Model Y to Chinese consumers earlier this year. Bremmer warns Tesla now has a challenging road ahead in China in light of the recent development by the military. Musk\\'s response to the Chinese actions are important for investors to watch, suggests Bremmer. \"At a moment of some white knuckle tensions between the U.S. and China, Musk & Co. find themselves in a unique position (along with Apple) of being caught in the crossfire,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said. Tesla shares fell about 2% on the report, as investors pondered if China will take a harder line on Tesla\\'s sales to consumers. \"One'"

But in the bitcoin market, the episode has proven to be a disappointment to some traders who were speculating last month that a new wave of demand might help push prices to fresh highs. “It would be very difficult to get a full picture of how that money moved from Uncle Sam into bitcoin,” said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, a market analysis firm based in Tel Aviv, during an interview with CoinDesk. Related: Daniel Loeb's $17B Hedge Fund Is Keeping Crypto With Coinbase – And Maybe Even Staking It Biden signed the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill into law on March 11, and the $1,400 stimulus payments started going out soon afterward, many of them via direct deposit into recipients’ bank accounts. Soon afterward, some cryptocurrency traders began to speculate whether some of that money might be used to buy bitcoin. Mizuho Securities, a Japanese brokerage firm, estimated that $40 billion of stimulus checks could be spent on bitcoin and stocks, according to a survey published on March 15. As recently as late last month, no cryptocurrency exchanges reported any major bump in $1,400 purchases, based on an informal survey by CoinDesk. Industry executives cautioned that it might be too early to judge. Now, those purchases do appear to be happening, according to some firms, even if they’re not the tsunami that some bitcoin bulls might have expected. Related: Bitcoin Still Trying to Break Out; Will Coinbase Public Debut Be a Catalyst Next Week? “We have seen a significant number of deposits in the amount of the latest individual stimulus check,” Steve Ehrlich, CEO of U.S. cryptocurrency brokerage Voyager Digital, told CoinDesk in an email sent by a spokesperson.

              "  'Peter Thiel, billionaire venture capitalist, and PayPal co-founder advised the U.S. government to consider tighter regulations on cryptocurrencies.  Thiel made these comments after he expressing worry the Chinese are using bitcoin to corrode the U.S. financial system. Thiel gave his more-than-skeptical sounding comments at a virtual roundtable for members of the Richard Nixon Foundation on April 7. “Even though I’m a pro-crypto, pro-bitcoin maximalist person, I do wonder whether at this point, bitcoin should also be thought [of] in part as a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S,” said Thiel. Thiel’s comment on the potential use of bitcoin as a “Chinese financial weapon” was followed by his forecast of its threat to fiat money and the U.S. dollar specifically. This comes as China recently trialed its central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC). According to Thiel, this “internal stablecoin” will amount to nothing other than, “some sort of totalitarian measuring device”. However, he did urge U.S. policymakers to consider these crypto-forward moves from a geopolitical point of view. This is not the first time Thiel has leaned skeptical towards China. In late 2019, the venture capitalist repeatedly backed the San Francisco-based startup, Layer1. This was a bid to elevate the U.S. as a mining hotbed against the Chinese and its bitcoin mining monopoly. Thiel isn’t the only one to take a stance against China’s potential intentions with digital currencies. Recently, celebrity investor and chairman of O’Shares ETFs, Kevin O’Leary, refused to accept any bitcoin mined in China. Although O’Leary did not specifically call China’s crypto frenzy a threat to the U.S., he was sure to recall out the human rights abuses committed by China and its continuing trade war with the U.S. Peter Thiel has a reputation for being a political firebrand. The ball is now the court of policymakers and legislators to decide how to proceed. Thiel’s past statements on Bitcoin, along with China’s overall policy toward the virtual currency, appear to be at odds with his most recent analysis. Billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel is worried that China is using bitcoin to undermine the U.S. Forward-thinking companies such as',\n",
              "  'Patience. Most people don’t have it because they let their emotions run rampant. It is not surprising when you have droves of self appointed authorities and other fake gurus amplifying this fear of missing out, or over dramatizing a minor random pullback like Bitcoin is showing now. Identifying quality opportunities begins with a set of very well defined rules. That does not mean they have to be complex rules, they just have to be adhered to. For example, one of our rules that is part of our long only swing trade strategy is to buy only at supprots upon confirmation within the context of a broader bullish trend. Since we don’t short Bitcoin, we don’t have to worry about that side of the equation, even within a persistent bearish environment (it doesn’t cost anything to stay out). So where is support right now? On the time frame that we utilize, it is between 52,500 and 49,500. That is a pretty wide range, but based on the recent proportions and price structure, that is where support is defined. Price is no where near this area which means our rules clearly say: stay out. Probability favors buying activity in the low 50K area and that can further be confirmed by price action. Instead of predicting moves, we let the market show its hand in areas where we anticipate a particular kind of activity. If Bitcoin can’t produce a compelling setup in an area of interest, all we have to do is stay out and wait. No stress, no fear of missing out, just following the rules. Do we miss trades sometimes as a result of waiting for rules and confirmations to align? Sure, but we don’t lose any money from missing a move. These words may be easy to understand, but putting them into practice means going against your own bad habits and emotional baggage. Improving your performance begins with developing your capacity for patience, not more and more information. High quality opportunities, especially on a swing trade time frame are INFREQUENT. If you are putting on more than 1 or 2',\n",
              "  'The bitcoin (BTC) price bounced on April 7 and created a bullish engulfing candlestick the next day. Bitcoin is expected to break out from the current short-term pattern and the $59,500 area after. Despite BTC decreasing on April 7, it created a bullish engulfing candlestick the next day. This is a sign that buying strength is increasing. The April 7 dip has now completely retraced. The RSI is trending above 50 and the Stochastic oscillator has made a bullish cross. Therefore, it’s likely that the trend is bullish. Since reaching an all-time high of $61,844 on March 13, BTC has been following a descending resistance line. So far, the line has rejected BTC multiple times—most recently on April 4. Currently, BTC is making another attempt at breaking out above the line. The MACD and RSI are both increasing, therefore a breakout is likely. An increase above this line and the $59,500 area would confirm that the trend is bullish. The two-hour chart shows that BTC is trading inside a descending parallel channel. This is often a corrective pattern. Therefore, the daily, six-hour, and two-hour charts are in alignment. A breakout from the channel and the $59,500 resistance area afterward is expected. The wave count suggests that BTC is in an extended sub-wave five (orange) of a long-term wave five (white). A potential target for the top of this movement is located between $83,500-$90,500. The target is found using a combination of Fib projections (white and orange) and an external Fib retracement (black). Both long and short-term indicators suggest that bitcoin will break out from the short-term channel. An upward move that takes the price above $59,500 is expected to follow.

              "  \"Blockchain data shows bitcoin miners are accumulating coins and adding to bullish pressures in the market for the first time since December. Analytics firm Glassnode’s miner position change metric, which gauges the 30-day change in the supply held in the miners’ addresses, recently turned positive in a sign of renewed holding by those responsible for making coins. The balance held in miner wallets has increased by 4,435 BTC to 1.806 million over the past two weeks, Glassnode’s data shows. Related: Daniel Loeb's $17B Hedge Fund Is Keeping Crypto With Coinbase – And Maybe Even Staking It “Miners [now] have a net accumulation of liquid assets as they have enough cash in reserve to run their future operations, having liquidated holdings when the bitcoin price was between $20,000 and $40,000, or most of them are holding in anticipation of a price rally,” Flex Yang, CEO of Hong Kong-based Babel Finance, said in an email. Miners predominantly operate on cash and liquidate holdings to meet expenses. However, the pace of miner selling varies from time to time depending on mining-specific factors and bitcoin’s price expectations. The return to accumulation mode observed since March 31 comes after almost four months of largely negative readings – miners decreasing positions and taking profits. Peak distribution of roughly 17,000 BTC to 24,000 BTC was seen throughout January, according to Glassnode’s weekly newsletter, dated March 8. While miner flows constitute a small part of the total network volume, as tweeted by Glassnode’s CEO Rafael Schultze-Kraft, accumulation by miners is analogous to increased promoter holding of corporate stock and is considered a positive indicator. “Their spending patterns provide insight into the sentiment of some of the biggest bulls in the Bitcoin market,” Glassnode said in a newsletter published on April 5.

              "  '(Bloomberg) -- For many investors, Coinbase Global Inc.’s trading debut next week will be an entry into the $2 trillion cryptocurrency market. And for those who have already gorged on Bitcoin, the arrival of the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange on the Nasdaq Stock Market could be what is needed to settle portfolios roiled by the asset class’s notorious volatility. There are other stocks already tied to the bits and bytes of the various blockchains. Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. and Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy Inc. have both notably added billions worth of Bitcoin to their treasuries. But with Coinbase’s public listing, investors will have the choice of an equity tied to cryptocurrencies that is -- so the hope goes -- less likely to suffer persistent cycles of boom and bust. “For a crypto investor that also buys stocks, it has the ability to diversify risks as there is a very profitable exchange platform that trades on another venue (stock exchange) whose flows of buyers and sellers can be less correlated than many crypto prices,” wrote Greg Foss, a veteran credit trader, Bitcoin investor and chief financial officer for Validus Power Corp., in an email reply to questions. Coinbase is planning to go public through a direct listing in which it will not raise any new capital, it said in an S-1 filing. The direct listing allows current shareholders to trade their shares without a lock-up period that is typical in an initial public offering. It was valued at about $90 billion in its final week of trading on Nasdaq’s private market, Bloomberg News reported. Still, because volume and price tend to go hand-in-hand, Coinbase’s transaction revenue, its largest segment, could remain susceptible to cryptocurrency market gyrations. “In a traditional stock portfolio it gives exposure to an exchange platform that generates trading fees on crypto,” wrote Foss. “Those fees increase with volumes and volumes typically increase with prices, so there is a beta trade there.” Coinbase said Tuesday that it expects to report a first-quarter profit of $730 million to $800 million, more than double what it earned in all of 2020.

Rather, the researchers estimate bitcoin energy consumption accounts for “close to half of the current global data center electricity use.” In China, researchers found that mining could even threaten carbon emission reduction targets.  In addition to the consumption of electricity, mining hardware is a contributor to the global e-waste problem. Bitcoin mining began using simple GPU and CPUs. As the need for power grew, producers began creating unique chips. Now, bulk mining uses Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). They are specifically for mining cryptocurrencies on the PoW algorithm. Cryptocurrency mining is a highly competitive space. Only the most efficient machines operate at a profit. Mining ASICs are being constantly improved. As a result, each new generation introduced to the market means older machines become unprofitable. The set number of coins and blocks motivates this constant improvement. As more efficient machines join the blockchain the total hashrate of the blockchain also increases.\\xa0 The quantity of bitcoins that any given miner obtains is largely dependent on the portion of the hashrate generated. This makes older machines generate less profit while still consuming the same amount of power. As a consequence, bitcoin miners buy an incredible quantity of computing devices.

His main issue with the article, primarily its headline, is that by focusing on the criminal application of Bitcoin, Wired is providing yet another reason for governments to attempt to stymie adoption. Gladstein’s criticism is context-dependent. Of the 18 articles Wired UK has published on Bitcoin, almost all – except for a glowing profile of the Winklevoss twins – were “negative,” by his reckoning.

              " 'GME': [\"GameStop (GME) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for GameStop basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock. Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for GameStop imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role,\",\n",

This gaming retailer will be selling up to 3.5 million shares and plans to utilize the proceeds to support its ongoing organizational transformation as well as strengthen balance sheet. However, investors didn’t seem pleased with the announcement, as shares began falling in yesterday’s pre-market session. The stock finally closed at a drop of 2.4% on Apr 5.In a separate release, the company announced preliminary sales numbers for the first nine weeks of fiscal 2021. Let’s look closer into these developments. GameStop will be selling up to 3,500,000 shares of its common stock through an “at-the-market” equity offering program (“ATM Offering”). The stock offering will be carried out from time to time, through its sales agent — Jefferies LLC. Industry experts opine that the company’s decision to sell shares will help it take advantage of the massive price surge witnessed since January, due to potential short-squeeze events. Notably, shares of the company have skyrocketed 918.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rise of 39.9%.  With respect to the ATM Offering, the company did not provide a timeline for completing the program. Management highlighted that shares offered under this program will not exceed $1 billion in aggregate gross proceeds. The net proceeds will be used to further accelerate its transformation as well as for general corporate purposes and strengthening its balance sheet.We note that the company is undertaking prudent efforts to fast track growth, especially by expanding digital capabilities. For accelerating business transformation, GameStop has been restructuring its board and has formed a Strategic Planning and Capital Allocation Committee. Since the formation of this committee, the company has appointed several board executives with significant experience in e-commerce, customer care and technology. Moreover, the influx of cash through the latest equity offering will further strengthen the company to undertake radical transformation initiatives.

              "  '(Bloomberg) -- GameStop Corp. climbed after saying it intends to elect Ryan Cohen as its next chairman, cementing the activist investor’s influence at the video-game retailer. Kurtis Wolf resigned effective April 5, GameStop said in a filing Thursday. The company said the resignation didn’t result from a disagreement over operations, policies or practices. Cohen will stand for election at the annual meeting on June 9, GameStop said in a statement. It plans to pay all directors entirely in equity, while reducing individual directors’ compensation by about 28%. GameStop shares rose as much as 4.4% to $185.88 in New York trading before retreating. GameStop had been on a three-day losing streak triggered by a company plan to sell as much as $1 billion in additional shares. The stock has had a wild, Reddit-driven ride, surging ninefold this year. Trading in GameStop, as with most stocks favored by traders using social platforms like Reddit, has fizzled over the past three weeks as amateur investors turn their focus elsewhere. The stock has been hit with bouts of volatility since January, when Cohen started to shake up operations at the company and as retail traders sparred with short sellers. As part of a corporate overhaul spearheaded by Cohen, the company has brought in new executives, including a chief officers for growth and technology. It has added technology experience to its team to help move the company away from its brick-and-mortar business. GameStop, based in the Dallas suburb of Grapevine, Texas, has suffered with the video-game industry’s shift to online distribution. With gamers downloading more and more, or ordering software and gear online, there’s less reason to make a trip to a physical store. The company reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings last month. In addition to selecting Cohen as chairman, GameStop plans to nominate two new board members: Larry Cheng, managing partner of Volition Capital and the first investor in the pet-supply retailer Chewy, where Cohen made his name; and Yang Xu, senior vice president of global finance and treasury at Kraft Heinz Co.

The hedge fund manager resigned his directorship this week because his investors fretted the bet on the company, which scored a paper gain of 3,500%, had become too large and risky, three people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Giving up the board seat allows Wolf to sell GameStop shares for his investors without restrictions to meet redemption requests, the sources said. Hestia currently owns 318,600 GameStop shares valued at roughly $53.8 million. It oversaw $75.6 million in assets as of the end of March, with GameStop being its single largest investment. Hestia has a mandate to invest in \"deep value\" assets that are unloved and undervalued. GameStop\\'s shares have been on a wild rally since January as amateur traders organized on social media platforms such as Reddit to snap them up, making them unsuitable for the kind of investing Hestia\\'s clients hired the fund for, the sources said.

              "  \"Nasdaq pares losses, after tech shares earlier gave back some of Thursday's gains Last week, GameStop (NYSE:GME) released its first annual earnings since the meme stock craze of January and February. Overall, they were rather disappointing. While not all of GameStop’s financial metrics for 2020 were poor, the most important ones (revenue and net income) missed. Diluted EPS underperformed estimates by US$0.08, while revenue was a full US$109 million short of expectations. If present trends continue, GameStop stock is likely to underperform. In this article, I’ll explore GameStop’s recent earnings and what they mean for shareholders. Gamestop’s 2020 earnings broadly missed targets, with the following metrics being among the key highlights: Revenue: US$2.122 billion, down from US$2.194 billion Net income: -US$215 million Gross profit: US$1.25 billion, down from US$1.9 billion These numbers were broadly poor. They missed analyst estimates and were mostly down year over year. Net income was one exception: the US$215 million loss was actually an improvement over the US$470 million loss in 2019. But overall, Gamestop’s most important metrics got worse in 2020. That’s not to say that there were no strong points in GameStop’s earnings report. If you look at the fourth quarter alone rather than the full year, GameStop did crank out a US$80 million profit. Also, e-commerce surged 175% for the fourth quarter and 191% for the year. There were some high notes amid all the bad news, but the overall thrust of the report was negative. Certainly, it wouldn’t justify the valuation reached at the height of the meme stock craze. One interesting question about GameStop is whether e-commerce can save it from its long-term sales decline. As mentioned previously GameStop’s sales decreased in its most recent quarter. However, the magnitude of the decline was not large (about 3.2%), and e-commerce sales grew 191%. In the fourth quarter, e-commerce made up 34% of total sales. Given that sales only declined 3.4% overall, it looks like another year of 191% growth in e-commerce could easily restore GME to positive sales growth. Certainly, that could come to pass. But the company faces an uphill battle.\",\n",

The GameStop bulls who see the company as an underrated, long-term value play may not be paying that much attention to the moves of the stock, but it’s hard to miss the roller-coaster ride. As the stock spiked on Wednesday, short interest continued to fall, perhaps after short-sellers learned their lesson in the late January squeeze, losing billions. But according to Ihor Dusaniwsky of analytics firm S3 Partners, the short squeeze will continue. “We should see the GME short squeeze continuing and more short covering in the stock as mark-to-market losses mount,” he told Yahoo Finance late Wednesday. “But as the stock continues its rapid climb, there will be short sellers waiting in the wings looking for entry points if this rally loses steam and GME’s stock price retraces.” Short interest may have fallen, but it’s still significant: $2.76 billion with 11.18 million shares shorted, 20.52% short interest percent of float or 17.02%, depending on how you calculate it, according to Dusaniwsky. (S3 prefers the latter, as it doesn’t count the synthetic longs created from a short sale. If this is confusing, S3 has a good explainer here.) To put this into context, fellow meme stock AMC Entertainment has a short interest percentage of float of 17.32%. Tesla, another famously shorted company, is at 5.98%, and Amazon at 1.03%. “This has not been a profitable trading week for GME short sellers, after being down -$1.36 billion on Monday and Tuesday,” Dusaniwsky said. “[Wednesday’s] +7% price move added another -$202 million in additional mark-to-market losses.” All in, GameStop shorts have now lost $6.8 billion year-to-date, Dusaniwsky said. — Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail,',\n",

If you want a black, silver, blue or red Tesla, and you desire sport wheels or a black-and-white interior, you\\'ll pay more. When you place your Model 3 order, you\\'ll pay a nonrefundable $100 order fee. That\\'s much more reasonable than the $1,000 down payment that was required to reserve your spot in line when the Model 3 first debuted amid heavy demand. Don\\'t get the wrong idea: A down payment will be required when you lease or finance a Tesla, but it\\'s due at signing — not when you order your vehicle.

              "  \"Japan is the fourth-largest auto market, and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) has historically had a hard time selling vehicles in the country. The Model S and X are too big for many of the parking structures in Japan, which require cars of a certain size to fit into movable parking spaces that help with the country's limited space. The Model 3 solved this by being just the right size, but prices were high due to shipping from California. But things are starting to change: In a story shared by Teslarati, Tesla sold 1,300% more vehicles in March 2021 compared to the same month last year: 44 units sold in March 2020 versus 588 in 2021. See also: How to Invest in Tesla Stock This was due to multiple factors, but the main trigger was Gigafactory Shanghai. This is Tesla's factory in China producing the Model 3 and Y. These vehicles are being sold mainly in China, but some are exported for delivery to Europe, Australia and Japan. Earlier in March, Tesla lowered prices of the Model 3 in Japan due to lower shipping costs. The standard range Model 3 price was reduced by 17%, while the long-range variant saw a decrease of 25%. There is currently a backlog of orders in Japan for the Model 3. Another factor is Japan's EV subsidies. The subsidies have increased this year, meaning buyers can save even more buying electric vehicles. Click here to check out Benzinga’s EV Hub for the latest electric vehicle news.

              "  'Elon Musk has revived the idea of building a 1950s-style diner at a Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) Supercharger station in Santa Monica, California. What Happened: The Tesla CEO said Santa Monica will soon have a \"major new Supercharger station\" with a retro diner and movies. Musk was responding to a tweet of a photo showing a long line at a Supercharger in the city. Musk also thanked the city of Santa Monica, possibly hinting that local officials are moving toward approving the plan. Musk mentioned the idea in 2018, Elektrek reported, quoting Musk as then saying he planned to open an “old-school drive-in, roller skates & rock restaurant at one of the new Tesla Supercharger locations in Los Angeles.” Though it wasn\\'t clear how serious the plan was, the company did apply for building permits in Santa Monica, Elektrek said, adding the project has run into approval problems with the local government. Why It Matters: One of Tesla\\'s biggest competitive advantages is its Supercharger network, which allows for easy, long distance travel for customers in many parts of the world. While it is unfortunate that customers need to wait for a charge, it also shows how succesful Tesla has become. As Tesla\\'s deliveries increase, the need for Superchargers increases. And as the need grows, so do the lines. Tesla has also considered adding features such as lounges and coffee shops to its Supercharger stations, according to Elektrek. Luckily, most Tesla\\'s vehicles can charge from 20% to 80% in less than 30 minutes. And with a 50% charge giving even the lowest-range Teslas well over 100 miles of range, a quick charge will let most people get on their way.

              "  \"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) is offering a new 50% discount for Supercharging during the night in metro areas in California, according to a report by Electrek. What Happened: Several California-based Tesla owners reportedly received message in their in-app notifications, asking them to avoid the rush and save 50% on their charging fees before 10 a.m. and after 7 p.m. at all Superchargers in California’s major metro areas. According to Electrek, the Palo Alto, California-based automaker started testing temporary Supercharger discounts in California last year. During off-peak hours, Tesla was charging $0.09/kWh – less than a third of the regular price per kWh at most Supercharger stations in California. Tesla expanded the tests to other markets including Norway and Sweden earlier this year. See Also: Electric Vehicle Showdown: Tesla Vs. Nio Vs. XPeng Vs. Li Auto — How Q1 Deliveries Stacked Up Why It Matters: The supercharging discount indicates Tesla’s attempts to lure people to charge at night and help reduce traffic at busy Supercharger stations during the daytime in California, one of Tesla’s most important markets. The focus on urban Superchargers may also be aimed at apartment dwellers who may face difficulty getting home charging. See also: How to Invest in Tesla Stock Tesla describes the Supercharger network as the “world’s fastest charging network” and has been looking to expand it aggressively, particularly in urban settings. The company said in November last year that it has installed 20,000 such units globally. Tesla has previously offered supercharging as a referral award and at times used the incentive to increase deliveries of its vehicles at the end of some quarters. It was reported in December last year that Tesla is offering a year of free unlimited supercharging to undelivered Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in North America in order to boost sales.

This would mark year-over-year growth of 216%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $9.92 billion, up 65.76% from the year-ago period. Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.27 per share and revenue of $47.86 billion.

              "  \"Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has so far failed to make a significant move back to an all-time high like some of its Nasdaq 100 counterparts. That could change: Tesla’s stock has set up two bullish patterns under a resistance level. The Tesla Chart: On Monday, Tesla’s stock completed the right shoulder of a bullish inverted head-and-shoulders pattern, reaching $708.16 — exactly $10 below its next resistance level of $718.16. The stock is trading above both the eight- and 21-day exponential moving averages, and it appears the eight-day EMA is about to cross back above the 21-day EMA, which is bullish. On Wednesday, Tesla completed its sixth daily candle in a bull flag pattern, with the first three candles in the pattern creating the pole and the last three candles creating the flag. Since there is a retracement in a bull flag pattern, traders and investors may be looking to buy the dip at the bottom of the flag before Tesla’s stock reacts to the pattern and makes a bullish move higher. Tesla’s stock could then stall temporarily under resistance at around $718 before jumping above it and continuing on an upward trajectory. If Tesla’s stock can trade above the resistance at $718, it has room to move up to fill the gap between $768.50 and $777.37. Related Link: Why Tesla Stock Is Trading Lower Today What's A Bull Flag? A bull flag consists of an upwards pole, where the stock price has moved up quickly with a flag formation at the top of the pole. The flag formation is a descending channel where the stock price retraces slowly and not by more than 50% the length of the pole. The flag formation is considered to be consolidation before the next leg up. TSLA Price Action: Tesla shares were down 3.09% at $670.26 ahead of the close Wednesday.

              "  '(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. first-quarter delivery numbers blew past analysts’ estimates, helping the stock fend off a slide in the broader electric vehicle industry amid growing skepticism about the future of President Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill. Shares of the Elon Musk-led company closed up 4.4% in New York, leaving it down 2.1% year to date. Over the past 12 months, the stock has advanced more than 600%. Other EV stocks like Workhorse Group Inc. and Lordstown Motors Corp. dropped on Monday. EV companies overall have received some good news in the past week, including a big push into electric vehicles in the infrastructure spending bill unveiled last week, and the estimate-crushing delivery figures from Tesla. But that may not be enough to stop a decline in the stocks that has seen investor interest wane this year. Auto stocks, EV and otherwise, have also been plagued by a global shortage of semiconductors. “The rhetoric around Biden’s infrastructure stimulus is what’s creating the weakness,” Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin said in an interview, discussing the EV selloff. “There is low certainty this will pass as proposed,” the analyst said. However, the underperformance in EVs is probably misplaced, Irwin said, noting that both political parties like the domestic success story of Tesla and would welcome a revival of Detroit with EVs. Biden’s infrastructure bill has already started facing its challenges, with Republicans saying they want no part of the corporate tax hikes needed to pay for the plan and some progressive Democrats saying the package would not spend nearly enough. Most EV companies’ shares fell on Monday. Workhorse lost 6.4% and Lordstown Motors closed down 4%. Nikola Corp. tumbled 7.8%, while Fisker Inc. and XPeng Inc. both ended the day 2.5% lower. Tesla on Friday said it delivered 184,800 cars worldwide for the first quarter of the year, outpacing the 169,850 average of analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey. While the company does not break out sales by geography, the U.S. and China are its largest markets and the company said it was “encouraged by the strong reception of the Model Y',\n",
              "  \"Last week, various auto giants unveiled first-quarter 2020 sales reports. Sales numbers were strong, thanks to rising demand for vehicles amid preference for personal mobility, widespread vaccination drive, optimism around federal aid and the gradual reopening of activities. In fact, the U.S. auto industry recorded the best March sales in more than 20 years. On further encouraging note, Biden proposed a $174-billion infrastructure spending plan to encourage Americans to switch to cars and trucks that run on electricity and not gasoline or diesel. The move was undertaken in an effort to boost the development and adoption of electric vehicles, which include money to retool factories and push up domestic supply of materials, tax incentives for electric vehicles buyers, along with grant and incentive programs for charging infrastructure. Meanwhile, global chip crunch is wreaking havoc on the auto industry and showing no signs of abatement anytime soon. Last week, trucking giant PACCAR PCAR announced that the chip shortage reduced truck deliveries by around 3,000 units in first-quarter 2021. The company expects the chip crunch to continue till first-half 2021. Further, U.S. auto biggie Ford F announced that it is shutting operations in several factories including two plants that manufacture its bestselling F- pickup amid the growing chip crisis. The company will suspend production at the Dearborn plant for two weeks effective Apr 5. It is also halting operations at the Kansas factory for a week. It will also suspend activities at the sports utility vehicle factory in Louisville for two weeks starting Apr 12. Operations at the Oakville plant — which builds the Edge crossover utility — will be shut down for three weeks beginning Apr 12. Tesla TSLA reported robust deliveries for first-quarter 2021. The company produced 180,338 (Model 3 and Y) vehicles and delivered a record 184,800 (182,780 Model 3 and Y, and 2,020 Model S and X) vehicles.
